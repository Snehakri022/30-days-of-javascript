# Day 1(a)
The ```document.write()``` function prints code directly on the HTML page where the script tag containing the code. 

# Day 1(b)
In Day 1(b) we use JavaScript comments, comments use to explain JavaScript code, and to make it more readable.

## JavaScript Comments
* Single Line Comments
Single line comments start with ```//```.
```
// Single line comment
```
* Multi-line Comments
Multi-line comments start with ```/* ```and end with ```*/```.
```
/*
Multi-line 
comments
*/
```


# Day 1(c)
In Day 1(c) we learn about literals and variable declaration.
A variable is a literal assigned to an identifier, so you can reference and use it later in the program.

## Declaration Types:
* var
* let
* const

### var syntax:
```
var x; // declaration and initialization
x = "Hello World"; // assignment

// or all in one
var y = "Hello World";
```

### let syntax:
```
let x; // declaration and initialization
x = "Hello World"; // assignment

// or all in one
let y = "Hello World";
```

### const syntax:
```
const x = "Hello World";
```

# Day 1(d)
In Day 1(d) challenge, print string with varible.

Write a JavaScript code to show this output:
```
Hello, this is my first challenge and I will do it 10 times. I will do it, I will learn JavaScript.
```

# Day 1(e)
In Day 1(e) we learn about JavaScript identifiers.

## JavaScript Identifiers
In JavaScript, identifiers are used to name variables (and keywords, and functions, and labels).

### The rules for legal names are: 
1. Identifiers can only contain letters, numbers, underscore (_) and the dollar sign ($).
2. Identifiers cannot start with a number.
3. Identifiers are case-sensitive.
4. Identifiers can be any length.
5. Don’t use words similar to reserved words

# Day 1(f)
In Day 1(f) we learn about reserved words in JavaScript.

## Reserved words
Reserved words are words that you cannot use as identifiers in JavaScript.

JavaScript has a number of reserved words that you cannot use as identifiers. Reserved words have a specific meaning to the JavaScript language, as they are part of the language syntax. Using a reserved word causes a compilation error when loading your script.

```break, delete, function, return, typeof, case, do, if, switch, var, catch, else, in, this, void, continue, false, instanceof, throw, while, debugger, finally, new, true, with, default, for, null, try ```

## Future reserved words
A future reserved word does not yet have a special meaning, unlike a keyword, but is still reserved by the standard and thus is not a valid identifier. The stated reason for this is that the words are used as keywords in proposed extensions and are therefore reserved to allow for the possibility of future adoption of those extensions.

```class, const, enum, export, extends, import, super```

## Strict mode future reserved words
The following are also future reserved words when encountered within strict mode code.

```implements, let, private, public, yield, interface, package, protected, static```

## Reserved words in ECMAScript
ECMAScript is a standard. JavaScript is a dialect of ECMAScript.
```￼abstract, double, goto, native, static, boolean, enum, implements, package, super, byte,
￼export, import, private, synchronized, char, extends, int, protected, throws, class, final,
￼interface, public, transient, const, float, long, short, volatile```
