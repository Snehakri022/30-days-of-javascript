# Day 4(a)
In Day 4(a) we learn about Loop (```do/while```) in JavaScript.

### JavaScript Loops
Loops can execute a block of code a number of times.

* ```do/while```: loops through a block of code once, and then repeats the loop while a specified condition is true

**Syntax:**
```
do {
  //code block to be executed
}
while (condition);
```
### Flow chart
The flow chart of a ```do-while``` loop would be as follows:

# Day 4(b)
In Day 4(b) we learn about Loop (```for```) in JavaScript.

### JavaScript Loops
Loops can execute a block of code a number of times.

* ```for```: loops through a block of code a number of times

**Syntax:**
```
for(initialize; test; increment) {
  //code block to be executed
}
```
### Flow chart
The flow chart of a ```for``` loop in JavaScript would be as follows:

# Day 4(c)
In Day 4(c) we learn about Jumps in JavaScript.

### Jump statements
Jump statements cause an unconditional jump to another statement elsewhere in the code. They are used primarily to interrupt switch statements and loops.

### Labeled statements 
Label statement provides an identifier for a statement that lets you refer to it using a ```break``` or ```continue``` statement.

**Syntax:**
```
label :
   statements
```
```label```
Any JavaScript identifier that is not a reserved word.<br>
```statement```
A JavaScript statement. ```break``` can be used with any labeled statement, and ```continue``` can be used with looping labeled statements.

### The break statement
The ```break``` statement "jumps out" of a loop.

# Day 4(d)
In Day 4(d) we learn about Jumps in JavaScript.

### Jump statements
Jump statements cause an unconditional jump to another statement elsewhere in the code. They are used primarily to interrupt switch statements and loops.

### The continue statement
The ```continue``` statement "jumps over" one iteration in the loop.

# Day 4(e)
In Day (e) challenge, Loops and Jumps.

* Write code:
```while```loop (label and use ```break```) and ```while``` (label and use ```continue```) inside ```for``` loop.
