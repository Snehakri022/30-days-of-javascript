# Day 6(a)
In Day 6(a) we learn about Jumps in JavaScript.

### Jump statements
Jump statements cause an unconditional jump to another statement elsewhere in the code. They are used primarily to interrupt switch statements and loops.

### The return statement
The ```return``` statement stops the execution of a function and returns a value from that function.

**Syntax:**
```
return value;
```
# Day 6(b)
In Day 6(b) we learn about Jumps in JavaScript.

### The throw statement
The ```throw``` statement allows you to create a custom error. Technically you can throw an exception (throw an error).
The exception can be a JavaScript String, a Number, a Boolean or an Object

**Syntax:**
```
throw expression; 
```
# Day 6(c)
In Day 6(c) we learn about ```try```/```catch```/```finally``` statement in JavaScript.

### The try/catch/finally statement
The ```try```/```catch```/```finally```  statement handles some or all of the errors that may occur in a block of code, while still running code.

Errors can be coding errors made by the programmer, errors due to wrong input, and other unforeseeable things.

* The ```try``` statement allows you to define a block of code to be tested for errors while it is being executed.

* The ```catch``` statement allows you to define a block of code to be executed, if an error occurs in the try block.

* The ```finally``` statement lets you execute code, after try and catch, regardless of the result.

**Syntax:**
```
try {
  tryCode - Block of code to try
}
catch(err) {
  catchCode - Block of code to handle errors
}
finally {
  finallyCode - Block of code to be executed regardless of the try / catch result
}
```
# Day 6(d)
In Day 6(d) we learn about Object in JavaScript.

### Objects
In JavaScript, an object is a standalone entity, with properties and type. JavaScript objects can have properties, which define their characteristics.

### Objects and properties
A JavaScript object has properties associated with it.  The properties of an object define the characteristics of the object. 
You access the properties of an object with:
```
objectName.propertyName
```
OR: 
```
objectName["propertyName"]
```
