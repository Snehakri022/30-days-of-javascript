# Day 10(a)
 we learn about Array in JavaScript.

### Array
JavaScript arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable.
An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value at a time.

**Syntax**
```
var array_name = [item1, item2, ...];      
```

# Day 10(b)
 we learn about Creating Arrays in JavaScript.

### Declaration of an Array
There are basically two ways to declare an array: 
* ```var array1 = [ ]; // method 1```
* ```var array1 = new array(); // method 2```


# Day 10(c)
 we learn about Reading and Accessing elements in JavaScript.

### Access the Elements of an Array
Access an array element by referring to the index number.<br>
Each element in an array is given an index, which is an integer value between 0 and one less than the length of the array. The first element has an index of 0, the second element has an index of 1, and so on.

**syntax:**
```
arrayName[index]
```
